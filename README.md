# predicting-which-passengers-survived-the-sinking-of-the-Titanic.

The Project is to predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.
The training set contains data we can use to train our model. It has a number of feature columns which contain various descriptive data, as well as a column of the target values we are trying to predict: in this case, Survival.
The testing set contains all of the same feature columns, but is missing the target value column.
The type of machine learning we will be doing is called classification, because when we make predictions we are classifying each passenger as survived or not. More specifically, we are performing binary classification, which means that there are only two different states we are classifying.     
In this case, understanding the Titanic disaster and specifically what variables might affect the outcome of survival is important. Anyone who has watched the movie Titanic would remember that women and children were given preference to lifeboats (as they were in real life). You would also remember the vast class disparity of the passengers.
This indicates that Age, Sex, and PClass may be good predictors of survival. We'll start by exploring Sex and Pclass by visualizing the data.
